# SUPER SCRAPER

This project has several scrapers getting price, stock, codes and some other information from supermarkets web pages.

Nowadays it supports some markets from Argentina, but the aim is to add as many sites as possible.

DISCLAIMER: Web pages are in continuous change, then some scrapers may fail eventually, please report when it happens so I can correct issues.

# HOW TO:

  Super scraper is built on the framework [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)

1) get a copy of the repository, both using git: 

git clone https://github.com/PabloAliArgentina/super_scraper

  or just downloading the zip from this site and decompressing
